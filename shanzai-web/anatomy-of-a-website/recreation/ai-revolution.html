                <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Sept. 18, 2025 -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
                    today announced a collaboration to jointly develop multiple generations of custom datacenter and PC
                    products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise and consumer
                    markets.</p>
                <p>The companies will focus on seamlessly connecting NVIDIA and Intel architectures using NVIDIA NVLink
                    – integrating the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU
                    technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers.</p>
                <p>For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI
                    infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.</p>
                <p>For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that
                    integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand
                    integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.</p>
                <p>NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. The
                    investment is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals.</p>
                <p>“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from
                    silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,”
                    said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI
                    and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem—a fusion of two
                    world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next
                    era of computing.”</p>
                <p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades – and we are
                    innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of
                    Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process
                    technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and
                    accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the
                    confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to
                    the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”</p>
