        <h1>Intel Newsroom</h1>
        <p>
            There are seventeen rare earth elements (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium). These minerals are required to bring your devices to life. Here at Intel, we acknowledge the effort that goes into mining and processing these elements. Thatâ€™s why we are determined to be transparent with our consumers about our supply chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like all material processing, the rare earth supply chain is bound to have environmental impacts. This includes not only the greenhouse gas effect, but also other environmental impacts such as acidification, eutrophication, and toxicities. Mining itself is also known to affect the environment through radioactive dust caused by blasting and mine sewage, contributing to particulate matter formation and ionizing radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, it is important to know the conditions of the workers who gather these materials for us. It is known that many of the rare earth elements are found in regions engaged in conflict, and that the money that these regions earn from mining is directly used to fund the conflict. We are working diligently to ensure that our materials are not conflict-minerals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, more laws have been passed to ensure proper working conditions. For instance, in 2021, the German Bundestag passed a law on corporate due diligence in supply chains, aiming to better protect human rights and the environment in the global economy. These include the prohibition of child labor, protection against slavery and forced labor, adequate wages, the right to form trade unions, and access to food and water. The law also considers risks to the environment, such as the release of hazardous substances or polluted water.
        </p>
        <p>
            In accordance with the emerging laws and out of respect to the workers and our customers, we have been putting a sustained effort into looking into our supply chain. After four years, we can proudly say that we have gained basic insight into our complex chain. As we work with over sixteen thousand suppliers, we cannot guarantee that our resources are conflict-free, but with your support, we can continue on our mission for transparency.
