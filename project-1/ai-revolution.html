                            SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Sept. 18, 2025 -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:
                            NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced
                            a collaboration to jointly develop multiple generations of
                            custom datacenter and PC products that accelerate applications
                            and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise and consumer markets.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The companies will focus on seamlessly connecting NVIDIA
                            and Intel architectures using NVIDIA NVLink – integrating
                            the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing
                            with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem
                            to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs
                            that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure
                            platforms and offer to the market.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the
                            market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA
                            RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide
                            range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and
                            GPUs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a
                            purchase price of $23.28 per share. The investment is subject
                            to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory
                            approvals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing
                            every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems
                            to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s
                            CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.
                            “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and
                            accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86
                            ecosystem—a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we
                            will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next
                            era of computing.”
                        </p>

                        <p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing
                            for decades – and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable
                            the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s
                            leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our
                            process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities,
                            will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to
                            enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence
                            Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and
                            look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow
                            our business.”

                        <p>This press release contains certain forward-looking statements related to the
                            collaboration agreement between NVIDIA and Intel, the benefits expected from
                            such agreement, and the anticipated equity investment by NVIDIA in Intel common stock. Words
                            such as
                            “expect,” “plan,” “intend” and “will” and variations of such words and similar expressions

                        <p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing
                            for decades – and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable
                            the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s
                            leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our
                            process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities,
                            will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to
                            enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence
                            Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and
                            look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow
                            our business.”

                            uncertainties as to the timing and success of any products that may be developed through the
                            collaboration, uncertainties as to the timing of the closing of the equity investment, the
                            potential
